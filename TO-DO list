1)Signal of interest Decoding -- done
2)Random Pilot insertion -- Pilot insertion completed, randomness needs to be executed
3)Channel coefficient estimation -- completed the model, just need to implement it for odd packet intervals
4)Channel Equalization
5)Sender channel estimation at even packet intervals
6)Change subcarrier length to N_subcarriers from N_subcarriers+cp_len -- done
7)Implement Reactive jammer - i)  Sensing arrival of packets just after preamble - 1ms to detect the signal for a 0.6 detection probability and âˆ’110dBm signal strength
                              ii) Strategy of shrinking the angle btw. sender and jammer signal.
8) Jammer signal detection by the defense mechanism.
9)Develop a feedback mechanism for Sender signal enhancement, which allows sender to rotate the transmitted signal in a direction orthogonal to jammed signal.
10)Extend this framework for multiple jammers.
11) Consider the case of advanced jammers, (Short-burst jamming)
12) Plot the graphs for each type of case.
13)Issue in jammer_coeff_ratio_estimation - alpha = jam_signal(1)/jam_signal(2); Line 4
